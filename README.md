Web application to look for our favorite musics

## Project Description:

You can use the research form in order to find back from words from music title. My memory sometimes leave me and I know approximately music title...
I found it would be nice to find directly cover album, artist and get the possibility to listen music to ensure which song I was looking for without navigating only with typing once the keywords.

## Must do before usage

Here we are getting data by parsing Shazam API with rapidapi website:
 --> https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam/
You would need to create an account to get your API key and be able to use the research form.
